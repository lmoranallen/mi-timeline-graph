# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

And that will boot the application.

NOTE: Within the personally assigned window (2hrs), I produced a skeleton and begin exploring the ideal package to drive the HTML5 Context drawing manipulation. Finding the package and getting set up wa a notable bottleneck in the assigned time but open to discuss more! 

The second task has been answered via `PROTOTYPE.md`
